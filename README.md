## :dart: About ##
The origin of the project comes from the fact that we often lack information about certain associations including BDE or BDS at Epitech.
My motivation comes from the fact that more people would like to participate in the activities of associations and to be more aware of partnerships.
I therefore propose to create a website that could allow administrative access to manage an entire association for activities, economy, planning, partnerships, etc.
## :dart: DÃ‰MO ##

```bash
    bde-epitech-tls.fr
```

## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: As a user I want to access the website to see the schedule of events, partnerships, and other category of information \
:heavy_check_mark: As a user, I want to be able to make an activity request to the association or a contact request that is sent to the association's email\
:heavy_check_mark: As an admin I want to be able to instantiate activities and respond to user requests directly on the site\
:heavy_check_mark: As a developer I want to be able to launch the site (backend, frontend) on docker, have full code documentation and a complete CI / CD environment\
